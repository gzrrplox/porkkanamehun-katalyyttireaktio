===========================================

4k intro for [Instanssi 2012](http://instanssi.org/2012/).

This was the third incarnation in a series of stochastic point rasterizers. Technical
details remain mostly unchanged and general code quality has degenarated to non-euclidean
complexity. For example I have no idea where the sounds came from, the synth broke and the C-macro
based timings were too scary to even look at.

But aleast it has ponies!

After this I decided to abandon C++ for Haskell permanently, as 
[GPipe](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/GPipe) by Tobias Bexelius had demostrated that 
the extremely painful complexity of OpenGL programming can be delegated
to a dedicated compiler behind a DSL.
